# Coptify
Coptify is a school project which aims to create a similar song streaming experience to Soundcloud/Spotify.
This project is intended to improve skills in website architecture design, UI, and Python HTTP server implementation.  
  
Coptify is a song streaming website (SPA + CSR) which hosts a number of songs. Users are able to create accounts and sign in,
play songs, and create and listen to playlists. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the single page app
and client side rendering, in addition to a Python HTTP backend server to serve the site and respond to API calls.
