# Coptify
Coptify is a song streaming website (SPA + CSR) which hosts a number of songs. Users are able to create accounts and sign in,
play songs, and create and listen to playlists. It aims to create a similar song streaming experience to Soundcloud/Spotify.
Coptify uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the single page app and client side rendering, in addition to a Python HTTP backend server to serve the site and respond to API calls.  

## Note
Coptify is a school project intended to improve skills in website architecture design, UI, and Python HTTP server implementation.  
The songs for the Liturgies of St. Basil, St. Gregory, and St. Cyril that are uploaded to GitHub are from Tasbeha.org
