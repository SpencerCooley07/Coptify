# Coptify
## Description
Coptify is a song streaming website (SPA + CSR) which hosts a number of songs. Users are able to create accounts and sign in,
play songs, and create and listen to playlists. It aims to create a similar song streaming experience to Soundcloud/Spotify.
Coptify uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the single page app and client side rendering, in addition to a Python HTTP backend server to serve the site and respond to API calls.  

## Note
Coptify is a school project intended to improve skills in website architecture design, UI, and Python HTTP server implementation.
